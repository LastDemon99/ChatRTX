With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or boiling on reflective walls. But with DLSS 3.5s Ray Reconstruction technology, each fence appears stable no matter how much light is illuminating the thinnest of its meshes.\n\nLights and reflections update faster and more accurately, too and each crevice in every room is lit with clarity, making the test chambers of Aperture Laboratories look as they would in the real world.", "start_char_idx": 8147, "end_char_idx": 10013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d5f6a78-67d7-4e02-ab76-fffa0416a895": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d5f6a78-67d7-4e02-ab76-fffa0416a895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\alan-wake-2-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlss-3-5.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11a0a583-e556-415f-aa4a-71d623a244d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\alan-wake-2-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlss-3-5.txt"}, "hash": "21f8ada139139185195b81f8bccf63ea6ba236d1da10535bd61ee428e42299ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6bde7fef-4355-4e3a-a37e-7ff6722082ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\alan-wake-2-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlss-3-5.txt"}, "hash": "a36a2fe5e8a62cddb5b5a5e7d5ddca8b62f24e2db1eba500a69ee18b5fe1eed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49834fa0-eb72-4a3a-9a8e-203813921ead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c80ddde4392fdba2214b0df269747ee49a75b6fe75713701c71fe187b2cd6ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8f0ffbc1e3affd561742922bb55cb129555542a040db0954ad23f9a503cb1bba", "text": "Ray Reconstruction will be available for all GeForce RTX users - get the complete lowdown in our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article.

In games like Counter-Strike 2, even small delays can impact gameplay, making the difference between success and defeat. This delay results from the cumulative effect of several factors, including the time taken by peripherals to communicate with the PC, the PC's processing time, and the display's refresh rate. This is known as End to End System Latency.\n\nThere are two main types of latency:  \n\nNetwork Latency: The time it takes your system to communicate with the games servers and services when playing online. As this cannot be controlled by the PC, and is based on the characteristics of your internet connection and your distance from the games servers, network latency is not measured in the system latency stat.\nSystem Latency: The entire end-to-end response time within your gaming system. It starts with peripheral latency, the delay from your input device; progresses through Game and Render Latency, which covers CPU processing and GPU rendering known as PC Latency; and ends with Display latency, the time taken for the rendered frame to appear on your screen.\nLatency impacts gameplay in several ways. For instance, you might click your mouse when your crosshair is over an opponent, but the shot might still miss due to cumulative latency. It causes a delay between what's happening in the game state and what players perceive on screen. \"Peekers advantage\" is also influenced by system latencywhen two players are the same distance from an angle with the same network ping, the player with lower system latency will spot an opponent before their opponent sees them. Furthermore, high system latency can make aiming inconsistent and less predictable, especially in games that demand quick and precise movements. In short, the higher the system latency, the more the players view lags behind the games reality.\n\nNVIDIA Reflex reduces latency by optimizing the rendering pipeline across the CPU and GPU, removing stalls by synchronizing each step of the pipeline. Reflex is most effective when the system is GPU-boundor when the GPU is under high utilizationas it prevents the CPU from racing ahead of the GPU, which can cause a buildup in the render queue, increasing latency.", "start_char_idx": 3530, "end_char_idx": 6233, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1d6fec5-67df-478e-a8f6-bd68c829527c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1d6fec5-67df-478e-a8f6-bd68c829527c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\counter-strike-2-released-featuring-nvidia-reflex.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "332fc9b1-10c9-4e3d-852b-6b255913e141", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\counter-strike-2-released-featuring-nvidia-reflex.txt"}, "hash": "7b0c1dd9cd8df7750c35f69a507d7934ef8348dedf48ebb5e6d496e3cf6f1921", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbdebbc1-5dc6-4e52-ad1e-664fa118f142", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\counter-strike-2-released-featuring-nvidia-reflex.txt"}, "hash": "984d329eaa33e7a149242a9727127e5edcf9bb8a7cb2111a9fe111f63e030eb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebb4b2e6-2d65-4a5f-8576-5de8c2c93da2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc49bd227b4e6f3e0f16439d10243a532bfc9771258bdb028f4cb1575e094fea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "55197f823460c4ed7fb57cb15215f6545656fb20466d8830a4a636d6052ec2dc", "text": "GeForce RTX 40 Series with NVIDIA Reflex On delivers the best responsiveness in Counter-Strike 2 at sub 15ms PC latency for faster target acquisition, quicker reaction times, and the best aim precision.

As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview, before committing a long time for a final render.\n\nThe benefit of Ray Reconstruction is particularly noticeable while navigating the viewport, as rendering during camera movement is notoriously difficult. But Ray Reconstruction enables sharper images with significantly reduced noise while panning around a scene, improving the real-time editing experience and allowing creators to share their work with clients and collaborators.\n\nChaos Vantage is a popular 3D visualization tool enabling creators to explore large scenes in a fully ray-traced environment. Vantage, which is already accelerated on RTX GPUs with NVIDIAs OptiX denoiser and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, adds support for Ray Reconstruction to provide further enhancements to image quality, providing a massive boost for creators navigating complex scenes.", "start_char_idx": 4672, "end_char_idx": 7464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d04c757-df7d-4012-8b14-f4c312c8e7ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d04c757-df7d-4012-8b14-f4c312c8e7ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\dlss-3-5-available-september-21.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9538daf5-e28b-45a6-88ee-d145d6ad1975", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\dlss-3-5-available-september-21.txt"}, "hash": "fa6ea6a07d74f0588266f04ddf31e8277497dd809d7fdc7049be81218c4a589f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca33a553-56ec-453b-acb5-feb2d0d68470", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\dlss-3-5-available-september-21.txt"}, "hash": "ebb4256d4ce62fadce22214942298d9bb6bac11eeecb1f5ae2a89c49d20b9675", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bea7044-68c0-4bb1-853d-80a84f7e6eb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8dbc17822bf5de766ad7e15009868eb2a9c3c127752b994f1466231b394c5092", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7823427575d03b4855296b8aa429b14fa4ba1cd23776d65083edf5d9b19567c4", "text": "Additionally, NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer, a fully customizable app for OpenUSD world-building that allows users to assemble, light, simulate, and render large scale scenes, will be upgrading to DLSS 3.5 in October.\n\nThe First Descendant Open Beta Is Ongoing, Featuring DLSS 3\nNexon Games The First Descendant is a free, third-person cooperative action-RPG shooter powered by Unreal Engine 5.

Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.\n\nOne of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.\n\nWith full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches.

To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.\n\nWith the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion.\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion.

Then, we turned the tools over to community modders who remastered Portal: Prelude. Today, were unveiling Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, the in-development community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time, Valves Half-Life 2.\n\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Using the latest version of RTX Remix, the modders are rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valves Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n \nAs with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing (otherwise known as path tracing) is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 RTX, average world textures have 8X the pixels, and assets like the suit feature 20X the geometric detail of the original game. You can now see the fabric weavings around the joints of the suit, and the interplay of plastics and metals that compose the chest, leg, and arm pieces.\n\n\nEvery light source bounces around the scene and casts realistic shadows, making Kleiners Lab feel like a real place.

Later this Fall, were bringing those optimizations and enhancements to Portal with RTX, alongside an upgrade to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, which introduces a new feature called Ray Reconstruction that uses AI to improve ray tracing image quality.\n\nIn Portal with RTX, textures are enhanced as Ray Reconstruction intelligently accumulates engine data and information across multiple frames to produce a more accurate and clear image. With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or boiling on reflective walls.

With ACE, generic NPCs can be turned into interactive characters capable of striking up a conversation, or giving you local knowledge that leads to new quests.\n\nAt COMPUTEX 2023, we showed our ACE Kairos demo, featuring Jin the ramen shop owner, rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX ON. In the months since, our team has continued to evolve ACE. Our newest advancement is the inclusion of NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, a new technique that enables developers to customize the personality of NPCs for more emotive, realistic and memorable interactions.\n\nMost LLMs are designed to provide only ideal responses, free of personality or emotion, as you can see by interacting with chat bots.

A sample of rays are then shot from the cameras viewpoint, determining the properties of light sources in a scene and how light reacts when it hits materials. For instance, if rays strike a mirror, reflections are generated.\n\nHowever, shooting rays for every pixel on your screen is too computationally demanding, even for offline renderers that calculate scenes over the course of several minutes or hours. So instead, ray samples must be used - these fire a handful of rays at various points across the scene for a representative sample of the scenes lighting, reflectivity and shadowing.\n\nThe output is a noisy, speckled image with gaps, good enough to ascertain how the scene should look when ray-traced.\n\nTo fill-in the missing pixels that werent ray-traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together. Through this process, the noisy raw output is converted into a ray-traced image.\n\nThese denoisers are manually-tuned and processed for each type of ray-traced lighting present in a scene, adding complexity and cost to the development process, and reducing the frame rate in highly ray-traced games where multiple denoisers operate simultaneously to maximize image quality.\n\nEach hand-tuned denoiser accumulates pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. It also interpolates neighboring pixels, and blends this information together, but at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough and creating non-uniform lighting effects.", "start_char_idx": 1463, "end_char_idx": 3789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "503d5607-912f-497d-8572-38dcd551ce77": {"__data__": {"id_": "503d5607-912f-497d-8572-38dcd551ce77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a8e82e0-3445-4682-9227-9f9ca65eb89e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction.txt"}, "hash": "792b24b776e2a78f7463954fc0aaf9f9596fab916c4243d925e3befc8e002caf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6577c9bd-3136-4ff7-975c-085e3528db65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction.txt"}, "hash": "f744d06de1b4fac9ed1045c34deee5ebfd1478ef274a8bb17847b2a46ab98f6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba72f196-0ed4-4588-8f8a-6b315ded4787", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c5f5712b7032e855d2f2b8fee38cdabeb9828b731109c55be840d2483912d1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "52bce112a4df3bb8d59ab9e9721e25406aff2b981611305e420c95787940ba11", "text": "To fill-in the missing pixels that werent ray-traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together.

And its technology even more advanced.\n\nDuring the course of Portal: Preludes story, players will encounter extremely challenging, advanced test chambers with more varied sights that with the power of RTX could well drop your jaw. Multiple layers of glass refract light, players move from complete darkness to bright locations, and dangerous hazards like particle disintegrators illuminate the world in deadly light, leveraging RTX to create memorable moments.\n\n200 new materials and textures, and 100 new models mesh perfectly with Portal with RTXs remade assets, adding extra variety to test chambers and challenges.

With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds.\n\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates.\n\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart also features ray-traced reflections with a variety of quality levels to choose from, as well as newly added ray-traced shadows, for natural light in outdoor areas. Gamers with GeForce RTX GPUs can enjoy these at the highest frame rates thanks to their dedicated ray tracing cores that greatly accelerate ray tracing performance.\n\nAdditionally, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart supports NVIDIA RTX IO, which leverages the DirectStorage runtime and GPU decompression to enable faster loading speeds and seamless in-game transitions.\n\nAnd theres support for 21:9, 32:9 and 48:9 resolutions, triple-monitor Surround gaming, the usual assortment of options to ensure you can play the way that best suits your style, and when using a DualSense controller on a wired connection you can feel in-game actions coming to life in your hands with haptic feedback and adaptive trigger effects.\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart launches July 26th on PC - wishlist or pre-order now.\n\nGame Ready For Remnant II\nRemnant II from Gunfire Games is the sequel to the best-selling game Remnant: From the Ashes that pits survivors of humanity against new deadly creatures and god-like bosses across terrifying worlds.

To learn more about RTX Remixs additions and improvements we spoke to NVIDIAs Nyle Usmani, Product Manager for RTX Remix, and to discover more about the creation of Portal: Prelude and the Portal: Prelude RTX remaster, we chatted with Nicolas and David.\n\n\"When I was able to get my hands on a pre-alpha early version of RTX Remix, I was honestly floored.\" - Nicolas NykO18 Grevet\n\nNVIDIA will soon begin sharing early access versions of RTX Remix with select modders to further refine the creator toolkit and runtime ahead of its official release later this year. Nicolas and the teams feedback has been invaluable, and has helped make RTX Remix even better. Stay tuned for further details, and be sure to join the unofficial NVIDIA RTX Remix Discord server if youre interested in using Remix to remaster classic games.\n\nThanks for chatting, Nyle; why did NVIDIA and the Lightspeed development team want to remaster or help remaster a classic Portal mod?\n\nNyle Usmani, NVIDIA Product Manager: As the developers of RTX Remix we knew the intricacies of the tool, and how everything worked. We built Portal With RTX, which proved to us that the tool was powerful. But its different for Lightspeed Studios to build a game with a mod tool, versus having actual modders get their hands on the tool instead. So we thought up this collaboration where we could give early access to the RTX Remix creator toolkit to talented modders, and get feedback on how well it functions in the real world. Additionally, we had thousands of remastered Portal assets from our collaboration with Valve, which made Portal based mods a logical step.\n\nAs fans of Portal, many of us knew about Portal: Prelude, the highest rated Portal mod ever made, so we reached out to its lead developer, Nicolas Grevet to see if he would leave modder-retirement and remaster his classic.

Id say they hit a homerunfrom the breathtaking visuals, the voice acting, the new gameplaythe end result is just incredible!\n\nThe NVIDIA Lightspeed team released Portal with RTX to critical acclaim in December. What did you learn from the launch, and how has that helped improve RTX Remix?\n\nNyle: Portal with RTX and RTX Remix as a whole are breaking new ground. When you play Portal With RTX, youre actually playing the original Portal but the visuals are passing through a Vulkan renderer. Its incredibly unusual to have an old school game engine pass visuals through a different rendererespecially one that enables path tracing, and can substitute the old game assets with gorgeous modern 4K versions in real time. It is a miracle that it looks and plays so well, but its also the first of its kind with much room for improvement.\n\nOne of the first things we focused on improving was the runtime, and its stability with substituting assets at playback. Between a more stable replacement system, and the development of RTX IO, which increases how quickly assets load in, players will notice that assets appear in the highest quality near instantaneously, and are incredibly stable in the scene. Furthermore, we made sweeping CPU and GPU performance optimizations that should enable more hardware to experience path tracing in all of its glory.\n\nAs work progressed on Portal: Prelude RTX, what changes and improvements were required to successfully remaster the original mod?", "start_char_idx": 3339, "end_char_idx": 5705, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26dada7c-3fd7-4997-921f-906492b52743": {"__data__": {"id_": "26dada7c-3fd7-4997-921f-906492b52743", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85c9b580-eb75-4620-9268-aa120cc8cfb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "018e5a0b6753a9e295244c4e26177ec5f1c1d4d27e8d2e8b7fde56929af3ed21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2745cbbf-3618-42af-b9a2-c2d7e5757ec9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac8586112b1bbf59bb6e2cc58d416a04c854c07117439a58cd35a129fe0eac69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e071207e9e7d9ef0f7fc04e1ca74004ac4ba3906b48ca7d2c032577974d581b9", "text": "Its incredibly unusual to have an old school game engine pass visuals through a different rendererespecially one that enables path tracing, and can substitute the old game assets with gorgeous modern 4K versions in real time.

As a result, we had a lot of optimizations we had to make to RTX Remix to ensure the RTX remaster ran smoothly. One such feature is support for replacing the meshes of skinned characters.\n\nFor Portal with RTX, RTX Remix could not modify meshes of skinned characters, and as a result we had to add polygonal detail to the meshes via classic Source mods. We hit the limit of what source modding could do pretty quickly, and when the modders attempted the same process in Portal: Prelude RTX, it ended up being prohibitively expensive for the CPU and GPU.\n\nWe went to work, and found a way to enable entire mesh replacements for skinned assets with practically no limits or performance overhead. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit releases, modders will be able to make characters 100s of times more polygonally detailed with little to no additional cost, which will be a boon to any RTX Remix mod.\n\n\nPortal: Prelude RTXs creation took roughly 8 months to complete - how much assistance from NVIDIA was required? How has this helped improve RTX Remix, and is the remastering workflow now faster and easier for modders?\n\nNyle: We primarily see our role as enabling talented modders like David and Nicolas, rather than creating content ourselves.", "start_char_idx": 4721, "end_char_idx": 7105, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2745cbbf-3618-42af-b9a2-c2d7e5757ec9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2745cbbf-3618-42af-b9a2-c2d7e5757ec9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26dada7c-3fd7-4997-921f-906492b52743", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "e071207e9e7d9ef0f7fc04e1ca74004ac4ba3906b48ca7d2c032577974d581b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "178792f6-877c-47e3-b51a-5deb02950ff4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f80b6a5390b68ac4f677aad4b3c4c1805ec4e6eb482111f8e2a140e26ff78a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ac8586112b1bbf59bb6e2cc58d416a04c854c07117439a58cd35a129fe0eac69", "text": "We hit the limit of what source modding could do pretty quickly, and when the modders attempted the same process in Portal: Prelude RTX, it ended up being prohibitively expensive for the CPU and GPU.\n\nWe went to work, and found a way to enable entire mesh replacements for skinned assets with practically no limits or performance overhead.

Since Portal: Prelude RTX was the first time the RTX Remix creator toolkit was being used in the wild, we worked closely with the team to provide technical support, take in feedback to improve the toolkit, and provide tips on how to work within a path traced model. The feedback we got was crucial, as it enabled us to make changes that sped up modder workflows immensely.\n\n\"The RTX Remix tool itself is insanely powerful and almost comes across as magic to me.\" - Nicolas NykO18 Grevet\n\nFor example, the modders frequently exported the mod to view their new assets, and get a sense of how they looked in-game. We were hearing that the export process to view changes was taking a lot of time. So we re-architected the modder workflow to basically remove the export process entirely. There isnt really a final export step anymoreinstead, the moment you ingest assets or make a change in your mod, the mod and the corresponding files update. What this means for modders is if you have the game open alongside the tool, every change you make in the creator toolkit will appear in the game instantaneously.\n\nPortal: Prelude RTX includes the worlds first integration of our new NVIDIA RTX IO GPU-accelerated storage technology.

What new features are you working on? And are you working with any other modders to remaster classic mods? Give us the details, Nyle!\n\nNyle: Weve been so immensely pleased with our collaboration with Nicolas and David, and the game honestly floors us. Portal: Prelude RTX has benefitted us, the gamers, and the RTX Remix tool. As for  future collaborationswho knows!\n\nTo keep up to date on everything we are doing with RTX Remix, I always recommend people check out our roadmap.\n\nAnd if you are interested in other RTX Remix mods (or are a modder interested in RTX Remix), I highly encourage you to check out the RTX Remix Showcase community-run Discord.

I was 13 back then, and it was a struggle to find any tutorials in French about how to do anything with the tool. I mostly worked on small maps and little projects for years, on Half-Life 1, Team Fortress 1, then Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, etc.\n\nIn 2008, I launched this large project called Portal: Prelude, which was much more than just mapping - it was a fully featured game that required roughly a year of work. It was a little clumsy, but the timing was right: it followed the release of Portal, and plugged a gap before the release of Portal 2. It had a very polarizing but successful launch. After that, I worked on an additional large project by producing a full-length Left 4 Dead campaign named I Hate Mountains with some friends, and retired from the field entirely in 2011.\n\nDavid Kralich Driver-Gomm: I started modding in 2014, creating addons for Garrys Mod, where I developed my knowledge in the Source Engine.", "start_char_idx": 10505, "end_char_idx": 12521, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8c9e581-62ca-49a6-b81b-d5678b9e178a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8c9e581-62ca-49a6-b81b-d5678b9e178a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e26c6eed-1e6b-458f-b202-872124d87851", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "556abe3610493348ee1865c0fe40c396a2b7a1369d570d5f5fe16fa0a2a1fc52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d6fecfc-a54e-4470-9fe7-c0c07f6e754c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d78d9d5fa16ea697f6a211ef6b0b07e729b36925aef675abb4e1fd412cc7918", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "942cf4b166d1e489e60011f3794bc52620cda153b664054bbeda26c2c3c41e5a", "text": "I mostly worked on small maps and little projects for years, on Half-Life 1, Team Fortress 1, then Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, etc.\n\nIn 2008, I launched this large project called Portal: Prelude, which was much more than just mapping - it was a fully featured game that required roughly a year of work.

In 2018 I started my primary mod project, Raising the Bar: Redux, as a Half-Life 2 cut content restoration mod, and it continues strong to this day. On the side Ive worked on a variety of other Source mods, such as being the lead asset creator on Entropy Zero 2 and releasing my own side projects like Goreagulation. Beyond that, I like to try and mod games with either very little or no serious modding support and create new communities around them - most notably, I helped construct a community around Bionicle Heroes, which now has a few dozen mods and reasonable activity today.\n\nWhat inspires you to mod?\n\nNicolas: The idea of being able to create 3D environments you could play into, and for which your imagination was basically the limit, was definitely the appeal of modding for me. I spent way more time goofing around in the levels I was building with my friends than I was spending building them. It was a good excuse for us to play stuff together and have fun. It definitely allowed me to create life-long relationships with some fellow modders that I consider great friends to this day.\n\nDavid: Modding allows me to revisit games I have a sentimental attachment to and add to their legacy.

For Half-Life 2, its just such a powerful and versatile platform for creation that, with my current expertise in the engine, means I can create just about anything I can come to mind with. The creative problem solving inherent to modding - working out how to turn a foundation into something else - is really rewarding, and telling new stories with familiar content helps expand the universes I love. Modding is also a way I can make up for the shortcomings of a game, like expanding the combat sandbox or making more detailed levels, and in the case of much older and more obscure games, it lets me reach out to other enthusiasts for rewarding recollections of the past. Ive always enjoyed tackling a problem and hitting my head against it until it breaks in, and modding is full of it, for better or worse!\n\nWhat's something about your content modding journey youve really enjoyed or were surprised by? \n\nNicolas: When I started getting myself involved in more serious projects like Portal: Prelude and then I Hate Mountains, I didnt realize how much the skills required to lead such projects would transfer to a real job. I definitely landed my first few jobs in my twenties surfing on the popularity and skillset acquired while handling these projects. Modding forces you to wear many hats: you have to be a level designer, a 2D artist, a scripter, a writer, a web developer, a PR person, a release manager, a QA analyst, and so much more.

I also use Blender as my primary 3D modeling tool as I find its plugin support and community focus makes it incredibly versatile; if theres a 3D format out there, chances are someone has written a plugin for it, and that makes it very easy to move from game to game and keep the same workflow.\n\nWhats the story behind the creation of the Portal: Prelude mod?

I was a part of a lot of communities and followed a lot of independent releases, but no mod and no serious story arcs were being released.

This is why I decided to launch this project.\n\nOriginally, the project was rather insignificant. It was not supposed to be a modification of the game, but just a succession of test chambers, without any real logic between them. I had no goal, I was just making maps as I saw it. And finally, when I reached a dozen test chambers, I realized that it would be a shame to waste all this work by only releasing yet another map pack without any real backstory. This is where I began to write a whole new story and decided to follow the famous belief that prequels were somewhat popular at that time.\n\nMy goal was to make it a personal project, without telling anyone about it. I wanted to surprise everyone by releasing a quality, polished, and fully finished game, offering roughly the same amount of playtime as Portal. As months passed, I had more and more difficulty working on it regularly. In real life, I was both a student and an employee, and that didn't leave me with a lot of time to work on the game. This is where I decided to ask for some help, mainly from Jrmy \"Capitaine Mousse\" Barbe, who helped me by making four of the nineteen test chambers while I was working on the final level.

In real life, I was both a student and an employee, and that didn't leave me with a lot of time to work on the game. This is where I decided to ask for some help, mainly from Jrmy \"Capitaine Mousse\" Barbe, who helped me by making four of the nineteen test chambers while I was working on the final level. Marc \"Moroes\" Bidoul helped me too, by making a few 3D models and textures.\n\n[It took me] nine months [to make]. Not nine months of continuous work of course, but nine months with some days filled with dozens of hours of hard work. I worked on the nineteen test chambers for 3 to 4 months, followed by 2 months on the final level, and 2 months of testing, debugging, and polishing (interfaces, voices, commentaries, etc.). It took me a lot more time than I initially thought, mainly because I also had school exams and my actual job to do on the side.\n\nIn June 2008, I learned like everyone else that Valve was potentially working on what we thought would end up being an official prequel of Portal (Portal 2). It felt like I was the only person on Earth not entirely happy with this announcement.

That wasnt my case, so iterating and having real players test the result has always been the crutch on which I relied most! Getting inspiration from other games, and real life locations has also been super influential in my process. This usually involves a ton of research and prototyping, like what we did on the I Hate Mountains project:\n\nThis is usually done with the games level editor directly, roughly blocking out the layout, playtesting it ad-nauseum, and iterating on decor and environment from larger features to smaller details. I mostly used the Valve Hammer Editor for Source engine-based projects like Portal: Prelude RTX.\n\n2D Artist: For Portal: Prelude RTX, I helped with texturing and more specifically remastering the existing 128x128/256x256/512x512 original textures into high-fidelity 1024x1024/2048x2048/4096x4096 multi-map textures supported by the RTX Remix toolkit.\n\nThe amount of work that a 4K multi-texture requires compared to a simple flat texture from the original game was surprising to me. Between the amount of details required on the albedo layer, the reflective map, roughness map, normal map, emissive map, opacity map, and more, it was definitely a challenge that forced me to learn and use more modern tools like Adobe Substance 3D and to have access to banks of high resolution pictures from real-life objects and textures.\n\nIntegrator: For most of the duration of the Portal: Prelude RTX project, I was the person in charge of doing the translation between the games old, low-resolution assets to the new, high-resolution assets.", "start_char_idx": 21054, "end_char_idx": 23290, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fac5d72-7590-4b96-a63f-4bfa86cc540b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fac5d72-7590-4b96-a63f-4bfa86cc540b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19ab752f-193d-4fca-937f-bc76ea2b25a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "286790bcd0fe43774a4cff4d80c51045fb363518bdce52859c40933bbf40752c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "098c54d9-b139-44de-bf68-65c6f17eaf2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "081a43f1f20b189affe89cde32c20798c2535947f18aa8c70d811567a4d59402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e82971b1add0c944063c4314127f41b28bbc1799f5afd30c506db7d0ca0476af", "text": "The amount of work that a 4K multi-texture requires compared to a simple flat texture from the original game was surprising to me.

This process was done using the then [early] in-development tool from NVIDIA called RTX Remix. This allowed me to take virtual 3D screenshots of a level and all of its assets while in-game, load this capture in RTX Remix, and literally replace every single asset (texture, geometry, light, etc.) with a 10 or 100 times higher fidelity version using open-source 2D and 3D formats. \n\nI wouldnt discount the fact that it also allows you to relight every single level with realistic path-traced lighting, which unlocked a ton of potential that old game engines could not provide back in the days.

So:\n\nGather reference material on the original asset - 360 pictures usually taken in engine, most commonly in Garrys Mod which has a total repository of all the Portal and Half-Life 2 assets we were using, which made it very easy for me to fly around the asset and get a close look at certain details\nLoad up the NVIDIA Omniverse version of Blender, which has USD import support and is my 3D modeling tool of choice\nImport the USD of the asset captured by the RTX Remix runtime\nUplift the captured USD in Blender - model new geometry, bevel out edges, and so on. This process would be more or less involved depending on the complexity/importance of the original asset and how much time I had to assign to it. Some assets were practically modeled from scratch anyway, whereas some - like pipes - mostly just had all their edges beveled out so they were higher poly and smoother\nUV unwrap the uplifted asset (usually my least favorite part, heh)\nBring the asset into Substance Painter so I can create high-quality PBR maps for the model and then work on adding additional details via texture/normal mapping\nExport the textures, and then prep for ingestion into the game via RTX Remix\nRTX Remix allowed us to inject these super high quality assets into environments and really go the extra step.", "start_char_idx": 23673, "end_char_idx": 25865, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e2964cd-2d93-4e98-8f33-98675a8947af": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e2964cd-2d93-4e98-8f33-98675a8947af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "098c54d9-b139-44de-bf68-65c6f17eaf2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "081a43f1f20b189affe89cde32c20798c2535947f18aa8c70d811567a4d59402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5394c2f1-09ef-402a-ae0a-8d0acabf9b01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8bcbafc7054923a239e1f94d74063c5c512555ad1326c00d1c8ac70a5f36f53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9c05ab1107d7b6b6d9fcfc48bc6fa5ebe22b2da6c7d63a10505651ab2f0c7ebb", "text": "This process would be more or less involved depending on the complexity/importance of the original asset and how much time I had to assign to it.

Prelude is quite different from the original Portal in that it makes extensive use of added assets and different environments than just test chambers, leading to a lot of unique cases where new props were used in Prelude sourced from Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, particularly in the last level of the game where you go face-to-face with scientists and their office-working environment. This presented a special opportunity to build an environment new from [those seen in] Portal with RTX. The RTX lighting certainly helped too, and thats considering the original mod was already very competently lit via Source Engine methodology!\n\n\nHow did the GPU acceleration and AI-enabled features of GeForce RTX GPUs assist in development?\n\nNicolas: During the Portal: Prelude remaster, I mainly used two features that required intensive use of GPU-acceleration and AI-enabled features:\n\nThe RTX Remix tool itself is insanely powerful and almost comes across as magic to me.

The ability to capture any part of a game, load it in a 3D tool and chip away at it as if this was being done using the original games level editor is insane.

Having a powerful NVIDIA card to bear the brunt of the load was essential to my productivity.\nEarly on during the remaster process, we played with AI upscaling a lot. When staring down at the daunting task of remastering hundreds or thousands of textures manually from the original low-resolution flat textures to multi-map high-resolution textures, it was greatly helpful in cutting down on the early work and focusing more on hero assets that required a more hands-on treatment, like character/NPC models, and large predominant textures.\nHow will NVIDIA RTX Remix impact the future of mod development?\n\nNicolas: When I first saw Portal with RTX in action, I kept waiting for the shoe to drop.

A lot of people are happy to play older games with the graphics of the time, but its also a very common sub-genre of mod to try and uplift the fidelity of older games for a fresh visual experience on a replay. All of that used to have to be done either in-engine with the tools provided, or with some very challenging work injecting new graphical techniques into a game.\n\nRTX Remix will do a lot of this work for modders in compatible titles, and as RTX becomes something of a norm as far as technology goes, itll be opened up to more and more people in the future. I also foresee that it will be a great addition to the processes for new mods and total conversions, as most asset creation pipelines today involve some level of PBR workflow that is then downgraded into an original engine. Overall itll simplify graphical remastering tremendously, and bring mods up a notch to be able to bat with professional titles.\n\nDo you have any learnings youd like to share with gamers or other mod developers about RTX Remix?", "start_char_idx": 27908, "end_char_idx": 30214, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88c81669-6c84-43e9-bb79-b3ed62781526": {"__data__": {"id_": "88c81669-6c84-43e9-bb79-b3ed62781526", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ce360e-9865-45cb-bf96-ad02ed35151b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "96adf2a52257ba755ca2cb0b70d4209f954b7fd1e76ebecbecb10fc2b49bac63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "846f1356-2c19-4a08-8994-b48ba4a70efe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\portal-prelude-rtx-inside-the-game-interview.txt"}, "hash": "3822dafea396bed41727225447e0d437e7302013e459057fd0c393cdedd70644", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d614c44-f51a-47e9-93b5-d38d56642de3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc79954bc40aea5064aeb307e28a54fde46b939fc8e2aba74cfc56c2e7c4e762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6d2fb227b79b20ae20a08e3573f5e3947d56901c5db5dfaa7f8b527d3d7d8f61", "text": "All of that used to have to be done either in-engine with the tools provided, or with some very challenging work injecting new graphical techniques into a game.\n\nRTX Remix will do a lot of this work for modders in compatible titles, and as RTX becomes something of a norm as far as technology goes, itll be opened up to more and more people in the future.

The tool can be overwhelming because there is almost no limit to what you can do with it. You have to be well-organized,  and segment your project early if you want any chance of succeeding. It usually starts easy, but when you reach thousands of high-fidelity 2D and 3D assets, upon layers and layers of replacement, you better be organized especially if youre working as a team.\n\nWith David, we made sure to have people dedicated to specific roles and specific sections of the remaster. David would create a 3D asset replacement layer and work on replacing legacy objects like chairs and pipes while I was working on a lighting replacement layer that only contained changes to emissive textures and lights. We had many such replacement layers, similar to how a layer in Photoshop would work, like 2D assets, 3D assets, skyboxes, lighting, NPCs, signage, etc.\n\nAdditionally, having a well defined, agreed upon file organization strategy super early is of paramount importance so that files for each replacement layer are easy to find, and well segregated can help a ton when working as a team. Having a version control system to take care of versioning for you in addition to RTX Remix would be a must-have in my opinion.\n\nFinally, you do have to think outside of the box sometimes.

When I say there are no limits, there actually are, and these are the limits of what the original game provided. It can be hard to replace something that wasnt there in the first game for example. Or it can be hard to work around a limitation of the first game that used a quirk of the game engine to make it work. One such example for us was working around pre-baked lighting in some levels of Portal: Prelude. You have to undo a lot of the workarounds that were made in the original game and replace them with better ones from RTX Remix, but it can require creative solutions and hacky workarounds to get to where you want to be. I think its part of the modding process though, and isnt necessarily a bad thing. You have to be scrappy.\n\nDavid: RTX Remix is great, but what we found on Portal: Prelude RTX, and what I believe is best for the tool overall, is that it works best when in tandem with other game tools. We used Hammer and level design to redesign parts of levels to function a little better in RTX; we made changes on the in-game side to facilitate better replacements by RTX Remix; and Portal: Prelude RTX received a lot more improvements, great and small, besides just the graphical overhaul.

Even with the incredible performance of NVMe SSDs, this goal has remained out of reach. Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of Input/Output (IO) architecture is needed.\n\nEnter NVIDIA RTX IO, enabling fast GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, massively accelerating IO performance compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU decompression for smaller data packages, enabling faster load times and lower CPU utilization, allowing developers to create a new generation of games with massive, highly detailed worlds.  \n\nNVIDIA RTX IO makes its debut alongside the free Portal: Prelude RTX mod today, and will also feature in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th.\n\nHow Does RTX IO Work?\nNVIDIA RTX IO leverages the advanced architectures of GeForce GPUs to offload dozens of CPU cores worth of work to your GPU, enabling faster game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games. RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA, which is utilized by both Microsofts DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.   \n\nTraditionally, data is sent from your disk drive to the CPU, decompressed through system memory, and sent to the GPU. This system is not designed with the capabilities of todays Gen4 and Gen5 PCIe NVME SSDs in mind, using only a fraction of their capabilities. Bottlenecks from the CPU and System Memory, combined with bigger assets, limit the gains from newer SSDs, resulting in slower loading of assets, which can cause in-game texture pop-in, or longer loading times.  \n\nTraditional Input/Output processes cause bottlenecks in todays content-rich games\n\nNVIDIA RTX IO dramatically increases IO bandwidth by letting compressed data be delivered to GPU memory with minimal staging in the CPU system memory.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2267, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74c366b5-55e1-490e-95a2-53878687e9b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "74c366b5-55e1-490e-95a2-53878687e9b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\rtx-io-for-geforce-gpus-available-now.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9fb29ac-041b-4fd2-829d-7065cf7f834a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\rtx-io-for-geforce-gpus-available-now.txt"}, "hash": "16067a20028956a7cb98fecbebb89871d7cdad9c34b25df2d870f214ef1a74f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8ff20d0-9b4e-4524-a5a8-403ff9c4f1c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "dataset\\rtx-io-for-geforce-gpus-available-now.txt"}, "hash": "505c7763d9e47198317c0d7674521c18734b920a3e48b9de9227a4ddeb52ec37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bb6b810-6378-4d83-b13f-570f9b6aa804", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "548e6f528fa305ad246389b79e7ced9887f56077c5bf90609cdbb7c0c7271e69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d93addab8393e3f3300e7cf7e3514785f11feda76f97584b749b0e3d6b750e49", "text": "RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA, which is utilized by both Microsofts DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.   \n\nTraditionally, data is sent from your disk drive to the CPU, decompressed through system memory, and sent to the GPU.

The GPU is utilized for decompression using GDeflate at high throughput, allowing the CPU to perform other tasks. As a result, object pop-in and stutter can be reduced, and high-quality textures can be streamed at incredible rates, so even if youre speeding through a world, everything runs and looks great.

When the RTX Remix creator toolkit is released, every modder will be able to count on RTX IO to enable them to stay true to their artistic vision, while keeping within the file size restrictions of popular modding sites.\n\nIn Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th, NVIDIA RTX IO is used to quickly load high-quality textures and environments with a high level of detail when jumping between dimensions. With DirectStorage accelerated by RTX IO, and the use of a fast NVMe SSD, the integration results in very responsive texture streaming even at the highest settings.\n\nRichard van der Laan, Senior Lead Programmer at Nixxes Software, explains: To enable quick loading and instant transition between dimensions, the game needs to be able to load assets quickly. DirectStorage ensures quick loading times and GPU decompression is used at high graphics settings to stream assets in the background while playing.  \n\nRTX IO Supports DirectStorage & Vulkan\nRTX IO is built on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA to maximize adoption and compatibility, enabling each Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) to add support in their drivers, and allowing developers to easily incorporate its technology across multiple platforms.
